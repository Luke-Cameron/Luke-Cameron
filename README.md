## Hey, thanks for stopping by, I'm Luke! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring dev, student at [MQU](https://www.mq.edu.au/), and part of the [WiseTech](https://www.wisetechglobal.com/) talent team in Sydney, AUS.

## What I'm learning :seedling:

**Frontend.** Getting the hang of vanilla js before I jump into vue or react  
**UX/UI.** Finding out where the buttons go, and the importance of negative space

## Icebreakers :snowflake:
**TTRPG nerd.** I've been running a 5e homebrew campaign with my close friends for over 3 years.  
**Average gamer.** Recommendations welcome! Check out Celeste if platformers are your speed.

## Don't be a stranger :speech_balloon:
